# Advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling

```{epigraph}
> "Why walk when you can flow."

-- Richard McElreath

In this chapter we will consider two very useful sampling methods. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is used in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), which is a state-of-the-art platform for statistical modeling and high-performance statistical computation. Sampling / Importance resampling is mot a Markov chain method, but can be very useful for posterior updates and when working with a finite set of samples.
