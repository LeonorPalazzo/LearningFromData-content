# Bayes goes fast: Emulators

```{epigraph}
> "Emulation is not rivalry. Emulation is the child of ambition; rivalry is the unlovable daughter of envy."

-- Honore de Balzac
```

In this chapter we will consider two very useful sampling methods. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is used in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), which is a state-of-the-art platform for statistical modeling and high-performance statistical computation. Sampling / Importance resampling is mot a Markov chain method, but can be very useful for posterior updates and when working with a finite set of samples.
